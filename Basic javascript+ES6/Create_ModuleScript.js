//!Create a module Script

//*ES6 introduced a way to easily share code among JavaScript files.
//* This involves exporting parts of a file for use in one or more other files, and importing the parts you need, where you need them

//*In order to take advantage of this functionality, you need to create a script in your HTML document with a type of module. Hereâ€™s an example:
//?<script type="module" src="filename.js"></script>

//*A script that uses this module type can now use the import and export features
